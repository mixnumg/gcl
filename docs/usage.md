# Using GCL in Chats
- `!` Fast Draft → 3 lines, bullets
- `++` Deep Analysis → Why×5, risks, evidence
- `>` Exec Brief → 1-page structure

Example:

```
++ Explain Kubernetes for non-engineers.
```

Tips:
- Combine with options later (e.g., `:tutor`, `:creative`)
- Keep prompts short; state domain first if helpful (e.g., `tech ++ ...`)
